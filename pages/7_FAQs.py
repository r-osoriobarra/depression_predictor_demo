        st.markdown("**Q: What is the Student Depression Risk Prediction System?**")
        st.markdown("A: This is an academic demonstration project that uses machine learning to predict depression risk in university students. It's designed as a tool for wellbeing coordinators to identify students who may need mental health support.")
        
        st.markdown("**Q: Is this a real clinical tool?**")
        st.markdown("A: No, this is an academic demonstration project developed for the ICT619 Artificial Intelligence unit at Murdoch University. It is not intended for actual clinical use or real student assessment.")
        
        st.markdown("**Q: Who developed this system?**")
        st.markdown("A: This system was developed by Rodrigo Osorio and Mia Song, both Master of IT students at Murdoch University, Western Australia, as part of their ICT619 coursework.")

        st.markdown("A: The system is built using Python with Streamlit for the web interface, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and Plotly for interactive visualizations. The prediction model uses Random Forest algorithms.")
        
        st.markdown("**Q: What data does the system analyze?**")
        st.markdown("A: The system analyzes various factors including academic performance (CGPA), lifestyle factors (sleep, diet), stress indicators (academic pressure, financial stress), and health history. All data is processed through a trained machine learning model.")
        
        st.markdown("**Q: How accurate are the predictions?**")
        st.markdown("A: While the model has been trained and validated using standard machine learning techniques, accuracy can vary. Remember, this is an academic demonstration and should not be used for actual mental health assessment.")

        st.markdown("**Q: Can this system be used in real universities?**")
        st.markdown("A: While the concept could be adapted for real-world use, this current version is purely for academic demonstration. Real implementation would require extensive validation, ethical approval, and compliance with privacy regulations.")
        
        st.markdown("**Q: What machine learning concepts does this project demonstrate?**")

        st.markdown("**Q: Should this system replace professional mental health assessment?**")
        st.markdown("A: Absolutely not. This is purely an academic demonstration. Real mental health concerns should always be addressed by qualified mental health professionals using validated clinical tools and personal assessment.")
        
        st.markdown("**Q: What are the ethical considerations of such systems?**")
        st.markdown("A: Real implementations would need to consider consent, privacy, potential bias in algorithms, the risk of false positives/negatives, and ensuring human oversight in all decisions. This demo helps students understand these important considerations.")
