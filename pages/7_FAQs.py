        <div class="faq-question">Q: What is the Student Depression Risk Prediction System?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">A: This is an academic demonstration project that uses machine learning to predict depression risk in university students. It's designed as a tool for wellbeing coordinators to identify students who may need mental health support.</div>
        
        <div class="faq-question">Q: Is this a real clinical tool?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">A: No, this is an academic demonstration project developed for the ICT619 Artificial Intelligence unit at Murdoch University. It is not intended for actual clinical use or real student assessment.</div>
        
        <div class="faq-question">Q: Who developed this system?</div>

    <div class="faq-container">
        <div class="faq-question">Q: What technology is used in this system?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">A: The system is built using Python with Streamlit for the web interface, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and Plotly for interactive visualizations. The prediction model uses Random Forest algorithms.</div>
        
        <div class="faq-question">Q: What data does the system analyze?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">A: The system analyzes various factors including academic performance (CGPA), lifestyle factors (sleep, diet), stress indicators (academic pressure, financial stress), and health history. All data is processed through a trained machine learning model.</div>
        
        <div class="faq-question">Q: How accurate are the predictions?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">A: While the model has been trained and validated using standard machine learning techniques, accuracy can vary. Remember, this is an academic demonstration and should not be used for actual mental health assessment.</div>

        <div class="faq-answer">A: You need to log in using the demo credentials provided on the login page. The system requires authentication to access the prediction and analysis features.</div>
        
        <div class="faq-question">Q: What format should my data be in?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">A: Data should be uploaded as a CSV file containing all required student information fields. The system will validate the data format upon upload and notify you of any missing columns.</div>
        
        <div class="faq-question">Q: Can I download or export results?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">A: Currently, the demo version focuses on visualization and analysis within the web interface. Export functionality is not available in this academic demonstration version.</div>
        
        <div class="faq-question">Q: Why can't I access certain pages without logging in?</div>
